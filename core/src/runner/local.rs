//! Local WASM simulation runner using `soroban-env-host` directly.
//!
//! Executes contract invocations in-process — no network round-trip to the
//! Soroban RPC `simulateTransaction` endpoint. The runner owns a small store
//! of pre-loaded WASM binaries keyed by contract hash and a snapshot of the
//! ledger state in which the invocation should run, enabling deterministic
//! replay against user-supplied ledger overrides.
//!
//! Execution is dispatched on a blocking task because the Soroban host
//! interpreter is synchronous and CPU-heavy; stalling the async runtime with
//! it would starve other simulations.
